		<h2>Chicken</h2>
		<p> Chickens are domestic or farm birds. The live span of a chicken is about 10 to 15 years. The male is larger and more brightly colored than the female. This is common feature in birds. The males show off their colorful feathers to attract the females.
		A chicken has a comb on the head and two wattles under the neck. The male has a larger comb compared to the female. The male is called a rooster. The female is called a hen while the young are called chicks. The female is usually ready to lay her first eggs when she is around six months old.
		The morning call your hear on the farm every morning is actually the rooster crowing "cock-a-doodle-doo". The female is called a hen and she goes "cluck-cluck". The young are called chicks and they go "chick-chick".
		<p>
		Chickens eat worms, insects, seeds, grains, snails, slugs, fruits, vegetables and many other foods. The gizzard which is a part of the stomach contains tiny stones to help grind up the food.
		</p>
		<p>
		There are approximatelty 175 varieties of chickens. They are grouped into 12 classes and approximately 60 breeds based on geographical areas : 
		- Asiatic, American, Continental, English, Mediterranean 
		See below for some of the different breeds :
		Bantams. These are miniature chicken breeds.
		Plymouth Rock. Originated in the United States.
		Marans. They are small breeds preferred for their eggs rather than meat.
		Leghorns. Most popular commercial breed. Usually white in color.
		Rhode Island Red Chicken. This is a very popular breed of chicken.

		Usually raised for their meat and eggs and sometimes as show birds. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The hen does not need a rooster to lay eggs. However, the eggs will not hatch because they are not fertilized. Chicken eggs come in different colors like white, brown, blue or bluish green and pink. The unique blue eggs come from the Araucana breed, from South America. Most chickens will stop laying eggs when the weather is cold. They will start laying when it gets warmer again.
		</p>
		<p>
		The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a population of more than 19 billion as of 2011. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs.
		</p>
		<p>
		Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in Southeast-, East-, and South Asia, but with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent. From India, the domesticated chicken was imported to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the fifth century BC. Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III. The chicken genome has changed less from feathered ancestors eradicated by the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event than those of other sequenced avian dinosaurs.
		</p>

		<p>
		In the UK and Ireland adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as cocks, whereas in America, Australia and Canada they are more commonly called roosters. Males less than a year old are cockerels. Castrated roosters are called capons (surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a year old are known as hens and younger females as pullets although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs at 16 to 20 weeks of age. In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term chook /ˈtʃʊk/ to describe all ages and both sexes. The young are called chicks and the meat is called chicken.
		</p>
		<p>
		"Chicken" originally referred to young domestic fowl. The species as a whole was then called domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of "chicken" survives in the phrase "Hen and Chickens", sometimes used as a British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands). The word "chicken" is sometimes erroneously construed to mean females exclusively, despite the term "hen" for females being in wide circulation.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the Deep South of the United States chickens are also referred to by the slang term yardbird.
		</p>
		<p>
		Domesticated chickens have been bred by humans from Asian jungle fowl.
		Scientists have shown that mother hens display signs of empathy for their baby chicks.
		Chickens are able to remember and recognise over 100 individuals; they can also recognise humans. </p>
		<p> 
		Like other birds and mammals, chickens experience REM sleep, which is associated with dreaming.
		Chickens have very sophisticated social behaviour with a dominance hierarchy where higher individuals dominate subordinate individuals. This is where the term pecking order comes from!
		The dominant male (cockerel) protects the females (hens) and they choose to feed close to him for safety.
		Chickens perform complex communication where calls have specific meanings. They perform over 30 types of vocalisation that we are aware of with meanings varying from calling youngsters, alarm calls, and alerting others to the whereabouts of food.
		Chickens have different alarm calls for specific types of predators, which allow conspecifics to know the type of threat they face and what sort of anti-predation behaviour to perform.
		Chickens are able to comprehend that when an object is taken away and hidden from them, it still exists. Young human children are unable to understand this.
		Hens are extremely affectionate and caring mothers. In Christian writings, Jesus is said to have used the love of a hen for her brood to express God’s love for humans. In Ancient Rome, saying ‘you were raised by a hen’ was a compliment.
		Chickens can’t taste sweetness in foods however they can detect salt, and most choose to avoid it.
		</p>
		<p>
		The chicken is the closest living relative to the great Tyrannosaurus-Rex.
		The meat and eggs of chickens are widely eaten by people across the world. Many people who consume animal products would like to choose products from animals kept in higher welfare systems. However welfare labelling on products can be confusing. </p>

		<h2>Beef</h2>
		<p>Beef is a year-round favorite, from grilling burgers in the summer, to enjoying a hearty stew in the winter. Beef is so popular that July has even been named Beef Month.  Sink your teeth into more facts about beef.

		Texas is the top producer of beef in the U.S., followed by Nebraska, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota. 
		Cattle are ruminants, which means they have four chambers in their stomach.
		There are over 94 million head of beef cattle being produced by 1 million beef producers in the U.S. Of these operations, 97 percent are family-owned.
		There are 50 breeds of beef cattle in the U.S. The most popular are Hereford, Angus, Brahman and Charolais.
		The basic cuts of beef are the chuck, loin, rib and round. Names for the cuts of meat can vary from region to region.
		One serving of beef is 3 ounces and provides more than half of your required protein for the day. It is also a source of all the necessary amino acids.
		The U.S. provides 25 percent of the world’s beef, but only has 10 percent of the world’s cattle.
		In 2009 the average annual per capita consumption of meat was 61.1 pounds.</p>

		<h2>Sushi</h2>
		<p>Not long ago, a sushi chef (itamae) had to undergo ten years of training before working in a restaurant. Today, demand for these skilled food artists is so high that many start work after only two years of training.

		Approximately 80% of the world’s bluefin tuna catch is used for sushi.

		Sushi dates back to at least the second century A.D., beginning as a method of preserving fish in China. See our “The History of Sushi” page for more details about sushi history.

		Nearly half the fish consumed as food worldwide are raised on fish farms rather than caught in the wild, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

		Japan’s Agriculture Ministry has set up a panel to discuss a certification system for Japanese restaurants abroad. Possible gastronomic crimes include slicing fish too thick, using too little or too much wasabi and over-boiling rice. Japanese tourists have also been known to complain about greasy tempura, floppy, lifeless noodles and seaweed that is not crispy enough. The ministry said its aim was to "spread correct Japanese gastronomic culture" and "improve the reliability of our country’s food" in foreign countries.

		The highest price ever paid for a sushi grade Bluefin Tuna was $396,000 for a 754 pound fish ($526/lb) on January 4th, 2011 at the Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo. What makes this more interesting is that this record was 10 years to the day as the last record. Previously, the highest price ever paid for a sushi grade Bluefin Tuna was $173,600 for a 444 pound fish ($391/lb) on January 5th, 2001.

		The United States Food and Drug Administration stipulates that all fish to be eaten raw (with the exception of tuna) must be frozen first, in order to kill parasites.
